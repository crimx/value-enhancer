# Reactive Collections

The Reactive Collections are a group of classes that expand on the built-in JavaScript collections, allowing changes to the collections to be observed. See [docs](https://value-enhancer.js.org/modules/collections.html) for API details.

```ts
import {
  ReactiveMap,
  ReactiveSet,
  ReactiveList,
  fromCollection,
  flattenFromCollection,
} from "value-enhancer/collections";
```
